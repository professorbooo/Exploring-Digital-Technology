This is a late start.....However, let's get started!
In the first couple weeks of the course, we used Windows PowerShell to run certain commands. A few weeks in, we downloaded Linux, and started running comomands on the Linux Shell. 
Learning about the commands on Linux has been very interesting. It's been a little difficult to remember what each control means, but with the help of the Command Line Crash Course, it's helped make remembering them easier.
Right now (March 8thth), we are reading the first couple chapters of the 'Learning the Bash Shell', which talks about the Bourne Again Shell (bash).
